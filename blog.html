                    <h3> Girl With Curves</h3>
                    <p>Let’s face it—the body type of models is far from reality. Slim people do exist in real life, but there are women with bigger sizes who can look just as good. People come in all shapes and sizes, but many of us have been conditioned to believe that only one body type is ideal for fashion.
                        <br>
                        This is the mindset that Girl With Curves hopes to shatter. Tanesha Awasthi created Girl With Curves in 2011 to represent everyday people who aren’t a size 0 or 2. The blog describes itself as an “award-winning blog made possible by people who believe women deserve to look and feel beautiful, regardless of weight, shape or size.

                    <h3>The Fashion Guitar</h3>
                    <p>The Fashion Guitar is the online blog of Dutch-born Charlotte Groeneveld-Van Haren. Now based in New York, she is a mother of two and runs her blog full-time.
                        <br>
                        Charlotte had worked with fashion blogs in one of her former jobs until she decided to create one herself. As a personal style blog, The Fashion Guitar showcases Charlotte’s own fashion sense. When she became a mother, the posts naturally featured her maternity and motherhood style, and it became a significant part of the website. Charlotte has worked with her favorite brands and designers, and loves collaborating with them.
